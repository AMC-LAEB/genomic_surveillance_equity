**getCountryData.R** is the script used to analyze global SARS-CoV-2 sequence metadata, as shown in Figure 1.

**singleCountrySimulations.R** is used to generate the single-country simulations, as shown in Figure 2.

**simulateGlobalEpidemics.R** is used to generate the global metapopulation epidemic simulations.

**surveillanceSimulations.R** is used to simulate the global genomic surveillance process, given the global epidemic simulations.

**GLEAMvalidate.R** is used to validate the metapopulation model against simulation output from GLEAM.

**getLeadTimes.R** is used to compute the time between first global detection and first local case in each country.
